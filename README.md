# Next.js API Route Handler Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when working with API routes in Next.js 15 and provides a solution.  The issue involves a POST request to an API route failing to process correctly.  The provided solution addresses this issue and ensures the POST request is handled as expected.

## Bug

The original `pages/api/profile.js` file contains an API route handler that incorrectly processes POST requests.  The issue lies in how the request is handled within the `handler` function. This example shows a failure to process the request, even though the method check is correct, because of a possible missing middleware, missing body parsing, or some other configuration problem.

## Solution

The `pages/api/profile-solution.js` file demonstrates the corrected API route handler.  This version correctly handles the POST request, processes it, and returns the expected response.
